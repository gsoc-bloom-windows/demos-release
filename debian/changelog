ros-bouncy-composition (0.5.0-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Updated launch files to account for the "old launch" getting renamespaced as ``launch`` -> ``launch.legacy``. (#239 <https://github.com/ros2/demos/issues/239>)
  * Updated to avoid newly deprecated class loader headers. (#229 <https://github.com/ros2/demos/issues/229>)
  * Added a periodic log message while waiting for a service response.
  * Contributors: Dirk Thomas, Michael Carroll, Mikael Arguedas, William Woodall
